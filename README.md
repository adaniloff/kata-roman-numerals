# kata-roman-numerals

**Convert any given integer into roman numerals equivalent**

This is a sample kata, done with SF4 symfony/skeleton.

### Tests 

You can run the test suite with `php bin/phpunit`.

### Usage 

You can have help to run the command with `php bin/console app:converter -h`.
Basically, just type a number and it will print you the roman numeral equivalence.

You can also use the converter if needed, by importing it as a usage and using the public static method `convert`.

Enjoy :)
